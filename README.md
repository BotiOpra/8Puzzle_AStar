# 8-Puzzle solver using A* Informed Search Algorithm

## TODO:
- Add solvability check
- Implement better heuristic function
- Organize code into multiple .h and .cpp files
- Improve time/space complexity
- Add option to show intermediate steps (not states)
- Get rid of unnecessary OO-Code
- Improve readability
- (Maybe): Multithreading for any sized puzzle (8, 15, etc.)
